# nice
# determines which process gets more CPU cycles
# ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority)
# default is 0

# ioclass and ionice
# determines which process gets more IO
# realtime - highest priority; can be further adjusted with ionice - ranges from 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest priority)
# best-effort - medium priority; can be further adjusted with ionice - ranges from 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest priority)
# idle - lowest priority
# default ioclass is best-effort; default ionice is 4
